# Assignment - Weather Forecast

## Grading
There are 40 data in the 5 day / 3 hour api (index 0 ~ 39) <br/>
Here we define： <br/>
First day : list[0] ~ list[7] <br/>
Second day : list[8] ~ list[15]<br/>
...<br/>
Fifth day : list[32] ~list [39]<br/>
You can use one of the data to represent that day.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you can use 16 day / daily forecast data.<br/>
First day : list[0]<br/>
Second day : list[1]<br/>
...<br/>
Fifth day : list[4]<br/>
